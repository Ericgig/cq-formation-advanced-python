Although it is based on a distributed-memory (processes) pattern, it doesn't provide scaling beyond one physical machine. For that, you need something that provides transparent network communication between processes. There are a multitude of solutions for this kind of pattern when using Python but we'll stick with an old, but proven, method called MPI."
